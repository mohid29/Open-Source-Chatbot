What are the benefits of having a Current/Saving Account for my Business loan?
You get preferred Processing Fee, priority processing and simpler documentation if you have a Current/Saving Account with HDFC Bank. This is taken into account at the time of disbursal of the loan. You can pay through Standing Instructions to debit your HDFC Bank Account with the EMI amount.

How long will it take for me to get a Business Loan?
